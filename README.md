#Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Website Developer project, originally created as part of a Software Engineering course at UTEP during the Spring of 2023. The purpose of this project was to learn how to host, create, and update a live website using Amazon Firebase. Our team applied various web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while adhering to Agile and Scrum methodologies.

#Project Purpose
The main goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience in web development and project management. Throughout the course, we interacted with a simulated "customer," who occasionally introduced unexpected requirements, providing us with a realistic understanding of the challenges faced in the real world. This experience was enriched by our rotating roles within the team, allowing each member to take on responsibilities in front-end design, back-end development, UX/UI design, and project management.

#Team Roles
Our team operated on a rotational basis, with each member assuming different roles on a weekly basis:

Front-End Design: Responsible for the visual elements and user interface of the website.
Back-End Design: Focused on server-side logic and database management.
UX/UI Designer: Ensured that the website was user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
Project Manager: Coordinated the team, managed timelines, and ensured smooth communication with the "customer."
This rotation allowed each of us to gain valuable experience across multiple facets of web development and project management.

#Current State of the Project
Since the course has ended, the original Firebase service we used to host the live website has expired. As a result, only the HTML files are currently visible in this repository, and sadly, the website's full functionality is no longer available.

While the code is still intact, the lack of an active server means that many of the interactive features and dynamic content will not function as intended. However, the project remains a valuable showcase of our ability to build and maintain a live website under real-world conditions.
