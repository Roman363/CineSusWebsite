    <img src = './pictures/egg.jpg' style="height: 20%; width: 20%; align-content: start; float: left; margin: 3%;"><br>
    <p>Hey! My name is Valeria, and I am currently a senior at UTEP studying Computer Science. I live with my mom and my brother and my dog, but I will soon be moving to Philadelphia for a job offer. 
        I am pretty nervous but I'm also excited because of the opportunities and experiences this will bring. I work as an IA for the CS Department right now, but I will soon be working for Lockheed Martin. 
        My goal is to move to the Space department and maybe one day work for NASA. I love space and physics and I want to get a MS in physics; my dream would be to make a cool discovery or help humanity in understanding space. 
        If all this fails though, my plan B is to be a frontend web developer or UX/UI designer for any company; I don't really have a preference. Thanks for choosing CineSus!</p>
